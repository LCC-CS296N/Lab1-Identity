# Lab 1 â€“ Identity and Admin Pages

CS296N, Web Development 2: ASP.NET

## Objectives

Gain Experience:

-   Adding Identity to a web app

-   Setting up administrative pages

## Instructions

### Part 1 -- Textbook Tutorial

-   Build the web site described in Ch. 28 of Pro ASP.NET MVC 2, or download the completed code, create the database, and run it.

-   Take screen-shots of:

    -   Creating users

        -   Validating password

        -   Validating user name

        -   Validating e-mail

    -   Editing users

    -   Listing users

    -   Deleting users

### Part 2 -- Your Web Site

-   Add Identity to your web app -- use the same database as the one used by your application.

-   Your user model will need to inherit from IdentityUser and will need to have some properties of its own. You can choose the properties, just don't duplicate the ones already in IdentityUser.

-   Add administrative pages to:

    -   Add a user

        -   Include password validation

        -   Include validation of user name and e-mail

    -   List all users

    -   Delete a user

- Add links to navigate between your admin pages.
